# Exploratory data analysis using Iris Dataset

EDA is been performed on the Iris dataset. It is a small dataset which has features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. With the analysis we tried to understand the dataset and the relationship between various features. Then we trained different ML classification models, predicted the output and compared with the actual output.
